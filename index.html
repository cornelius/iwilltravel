<p>In spring 2012 I participated in Stanford's <a href="http://hci-class.com">Human-Computer Interaction online class</a>. I was curious to see how such an online class would work out, and the topic was one which I cared about for a long time already.</p>
<p>The class consisted of a series of video lectures, some quizes to check the learning progress, and a practical assignment. The assignment was set up as an ongoing project to go through the different stages of the creation of a user interface, from need-finding, over quick prototyping, to design and test of the user interface. Each stage came with a peer-assignment phase were you got feedback on your own work, and also got to give feedback on other projects. It was fascinating to see what others did. There was a lot of creative energy in the course.</p>
<p>This is the story of my project, which ended up being a personal travel assistant.</p>
