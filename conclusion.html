<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>It was an intense course. Especially the practical assignment and the peer-assessment took quite some effort. But it was rewarding to go through all the steps required to create good human-computer interaction, get feedback, and apply the theory from the lectures to a concrete use case. In this dense form it created a lot of insight in what it takes to design good user interfaces.</p>

<p>The course also showed that human-computer interaction is no black magic or something, which needs excessive amounts of artistic skills, or inspiration from nowhere. It's really just a part of the engineering process, and if the right methods are applied with care and thinking, the results will be good.</p>

<p>So I enjoyed the course, learned some new and interesting things, and also got a half-working application for planning my travel. It would be fun to add the other half as well, but that's something, I'll leave for a a different time, at least for now.</p>

<p>Oh, and I also got a certificate:</p>
