<h1>Prototyping</h1>

<p class="question">Which of the design briefs does your observation fall under: Change, Glance, or Time? Write down your Point of View.</p>

<p>Design brief: Glance</p>

<p class="question">Point of View:</p>

<p>When preparing to travel you need to remember and take care of lots of things. An assistant will collect all required information and guide you through what needs to be done. So you have the overview at a glance, and can relax and focus on the actual goal of your trip.</p>


<p class="question">Upload a comprehensive set of digital photos or scans of both of your storyboards.</p>

<p>The first storyboard addresses the point of view by using something like a graphical todo list as assistant to get an overview:</p>

<p>The second storyboard takes the approach of assisting with the interaction of different people to collect the information, which gives the overview:</p>

<p class="question">
Upload a PDF your rapid prototypes created with Balsamiq.</p>


<p>I chose the graphical todo list assistant for creating two rapid prototype designs.</p>

<p>The first uses a graphical hierarchy for navigation using pictures to illustrate the items and trigger associations as well as a enjoyable experience:</p>

<p>The second uses an illustrated text document for creating the narrative of the trip including the necessary todo items. It provides controls to enter user-provided input and populates the document automatically with data which can be deduced from the already entered information. It also shows a status summary. When all items are checked the summary goes to "ready to fly" and the user is done.</p>
